On the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) there are a few simple examples of how to use different TypeGraphQL features and how well they integrate with 3rd party libraries.

All examples have an `examples.gql` file with sample queries/mutations/subscriptions that we can execute.

## Basics

- [Simple usage of fields, basic types and resolvers](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/simple-usage)

## Advanced

- [Enums and unions](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/enums-and-unions)
- [Subscriptions (simple)](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/simple-subscriptions)
- [Subscriptions (using Redis)](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/redis-subscriptions)
- [Interfaces](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/interfaces-inheritance)
- [Extensions (metadata)](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/extensions)

## Features usage

- [Dependency injection (IoC container)](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/using-container)
  - [Scoped containers](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/using-scoped-container)
- [Authorization](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/authorization)
- [Validation](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/automatic-validation)
  - [Custom validation](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/custom-validation)
- [Types inheritance](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/interfaces-inheritance)
- [Resolvers inheritance](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/resolvers-inheritance)
- [Generic types](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/generic-types)
- [Mixin classes](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/mixin-classes)
- [Middlewares and Custom Decorators](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/middlewares-custom-decorators)
- [Query complexity](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/query-complexity)

## 3rd party libs integration

- [TypeORM (manual, synchronous) \*](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/typeorm-basic-usage)
- [TypeORM (automatic, lazy relations) \*](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/typeorm-lazy-relations)
- [MikroORM](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/mikro-orm)
- [Typegoose](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/typegoose)
- [Apollo federation](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/apollo-federation)
- [Apollo Cache Control](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/apollo-cache)
- [Apollo Client local state](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/apollo-client)
- [GraphQL Modules](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/master/examples/graphql-modules)

_\* Note that we need to edit the TypeORM example's `index.ts` with the credentials of our local database_
