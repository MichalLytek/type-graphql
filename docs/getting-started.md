To explore all of the powerful capabilities of TypeGraphQL, we will create a sample GraphQL API for cooking recipes.

Let's start with the `Recipe` type, which is the foundation of our API.

## Types

Our goal is to get the equivalent of this type described in SDL:

```graphql
type Recipe {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  creationDate: Date!
  ingredients: [String!]!
}
```

So we create the `Recipe` class with all its properties and types:

```typescript
class Recipe {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  creationDate: Date;
  ingredients: string[];
}
```

Then we decorate the class and its properties with decorators:

```typescript
@ObjectType()
class Recipe {
  @Field(type => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  description?: string;

  @Field()
  creationDate: Date;

  @Field(type => [String])
  ingredients: string[];
}
```

The detailed rules of when to use `nullable`, `array` and others are described in the [fields and types docs](types-and-fields.md).

## Resolvers

After that we want to create typical crud queries and mutations. To do so, we create the resolver (controller) class that will have injected the `RecipeService` in the constructor:

```typescript
@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  constructor(private recipeService: RecipeService) {}

  @Query(returns => Recipe)
  async recipe(@Arg("id") id: string) {
    const recipe = await this.recipeService.findById(id);
    if (recipe === undefined) {
      throw new RecipeNotFoundError(id);
    }
    return recipe;
  }

  @Query(returns => [Recipe])
  recipes(@Args() { skip, take }: RecipesArgs) {
    return this.recipeService.findAll({ skip, take });
  }

  @Mutation(returns => Recipe)
  @Authorized()
  addRecipe(
    @Arg("newRecipeData") newRecipeData: NewRecipeInput,
    @Ctx("user") user: User,
  ): Promise<Recipe> {
    return this.recipeService.addNew({ data: newRecipeData, user });
  }

  @Mutation(returns => Boolean)
  @Authorized(Roles.Admin)
  async removeRecipe(@Arg("id") id: string) {
    try {
      await this.recipeService.removeById(id);
      return true;
    } catch {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

We use the `@Authorized()` decorator to restrict access to authorized users only or the users that fulfil the roles requirements.
The detailed rules for when and why we declare `returns => Recipe` functions and others are described in [resolvers docs](resolvers.md).

## Inputs and Arguments

Ok, but what are `NewRecipeInput` and `RecipesArgs`? They are of course classes:

```typescript
@InputType()
class NewRecipeDataInput {
  @Field()
  @MaxLength(30)
  title: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  @Length(30, 255)
  description?: string;

  @Field(type => [String])
  @MaxArraySize(30)
  ingredients: string[];
}

@ArgsType()
class RecipesArgs {
  @Field(type => Int)
  @Min(0)
  skip: number = 0;

  @Field(type => Int)
  @Min(1)
  @Max(50)
  take: number = 25;
}
```

`@Length`, `@Min` and `@MaxArraySize` are decorators from [`class-validator`](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) that automatically perform field validation in TypeGraphQL.

## Building schema

The last step that needs to be done is to actually build the schema from the TypeGraphQL definition. We use the `buildSchema` function for this:

```typescript
const schema = await buildSchema({
  resolvers: [RecipeResolver],
});

// ...creating express server or sth
```

Et voil√†! Now we have fully functional GraphQL schema!
If we print it, this is how it would look:

```graphql
type Recipe {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  creationDate: Date!
  ingredients: [String!]!
}
input NewRecipeInput {
  title: String!
  description: String
  ingredients: [String!]!
}
type Query {
  recipe(id: ID!): Recipe
  recipes(skip: Int = 0, take: Int = 25): [Recipe!]!
}
type Mutation {
  addRecipe(newRecipeData: NewRecipeInput!): Recipe!
  removeRecipe(id: ID!): Boolean!
}
```

## Want more?

That was only the tip of the iceberg - a very simple example with basic GraphQL types. Do you use interfaces, enums, unions and custom scalars? That's great because TypeGraphQL fully supports them too! There are also more advanced concepts like the authorization checker, inheritance support and field resolvers.

A lot of these topics are covered in Ben Awad's [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad)'s [TypeGraphQL video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlma1bBu3Tloe4NyYn9Ko8Gs) on YouTube.

For more complicated cases, go to the [Examples section](examples.md) where you can discover e.g. how well TypeGraphQL integrates with TypeORM.
