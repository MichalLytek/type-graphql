# Examples

This folder consist of simple examples showing how to use different `TypeGraphQL` features and how well it integrates with 3rd party libraries.

All examples has a `examples.gql` file with sample queries/mutations/subscriptions that you can execute.

> **Note**: Be aware that the examples on master branch are designed to work with latest codebase that might not be released yet.
So if you are looking for examples that are compatible with the version you use, just browse the files by the git tag, e.g. [`tree/v0.16.0` for `0.16.0` release](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/v0.16.0/examples).

## Basics

## Advanced

- [Subscriptions (simple)](./simple-subscriptions)
- [Subscriptions (using Redis)](./redis-subscriptions)
- [Interfaces](./interfaces-inheritance)

## Features usage

- [Dependency injection (IoC container)](./using-container)
  - [(scoped container)](./using-scoped-container)
- [Authorization](./authorization)
- [Validation](./automatic-validation)
- [Types inheritance](./interfaces-inheritance)
- [Resolvers inheritance](./resolvers-inheritance)
- [Generic types](./generic-types)
- [Middlewares and custom decorators](./middlewares-custom-decorators)

## 3rd party libs integration

- [TypeORM (manual, synchronous) \*](./typeorm-basic-usage)
- [TypeORM (automatic, lazy relations) \*](./typeorm-lazy-relations)
- [Typegoose](./typegoose)
- [Apollo Engine (Apollo Cache Control) \*\*](./apollo-engine)
- [Apollo client state](./apollo-client)

_\* Note that you need to edit the TypeORM examples `index.ts` with credentials to your local database_

_\*\* Note that you need to provide `APOLLO_ENGINE_API_KEY` env variable with your own API key_
